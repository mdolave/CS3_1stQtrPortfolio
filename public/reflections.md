# End of Quarter Reflections by Miguel Olave of 9 - Cesium

Good day, Ma'am Aline! I am Miguel Olave, a lateral entrant of Batch 2029, 9 - Cesium.

Although I had no prior experience in coding, especially when it comes to implementing arithmetic with it, I enjoyed learning about how I could express my creativity in new ways through technology. For me, I found it challenging especially the second long test (huhu), but I think I would enjoy the next topics about web development. As a great Greek philosopher once said,

## Prompts for Reflection

### _List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences._
1. **Ternary Operators** - Ternary operators are convenient in coding and, personally, I find aesthetic value in them as they add readability to the program. Ternary operators are usually written in the format: ` condition ? execute_if_true : execute_if_false `. When I was studying for the long tests, implementing it in my code was one of the primary things I focused on. At first glance, they can look tedious or confusing, but it enhances a programmer's ability to program quickly, especially when they are under time pressure. Ternary operators are used as shortcuts for either `if (condition) {execute_if_true} else {execute_if_false}` or `if (condition) {execute_if_true} else if (condition) {execute_if_true} else(condition) ... else {execute_if_none_applies}`.
2. **Variable Declaration** - This was one of the first topics discussed, and surprisingly, I found it relatively easy compared to the other lessons. You can assign values to variables in multiple ways; var, const, let, or simply assigning it to a value such as `x = 5`. Their differences lie in their abilities to hoist. `Var x = value` allows you to redeclare `x`'s value, where as `const x = value` and `let x = value` do not. Let's scope is limited to the code block where it was declared, unlike const whose scope is limited to either global or local.
3. **Concatenation** - I find this to be one of the most interesting topics in Javascript. Since Javascript is a loose programming language, concatenation happens when a number type variable is added to a string or vice versa. In the multiple choice sections of the long tests, the concatenation problems are probably one of the most confusing since it requires logic and reading comprehension.
4. **Data Types** - These types of questions in the long tests are fun to answer because all they require is conceptual understanding and reading comprehension. For me, I enjoy these types of questions more than the practical exam part because I find it easier to understand concepts than applying them. There are multiple data types, and some examples of which are number `var x = parseFloat(3.14)`, string `var x = "Hello"`, and boolean `x = true || false`. Although Javascript is loosely-typed, data types are important in ensuring smooth program execution, especially in comparisons.
5. **Naming Variables** - I think I also have ample understanding on naming variables. It is important to give quality name to variables so when coding, you do not get confused on which to use. Variables should be named following the camelCase. `var getCalculation = 6 - 5`. 

### _List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed._ 
1. **Function Declaration** - In the long test, I struggled in declaring functions. I need further practice in this because it's a very recent topic, and it is different from declaring variables. Though functions are useful in the long run as they allow you to use a block of code again conveniently, I must know how to first declare them. There are two ways: *function as declaration* or *function as expression*

``` javascript
function functionName(parameter) {
    blockCode;
    return;
}
```

or

``` javascript
var/let/const functionName = function(parameter) {
    blockCode;
    return;
}
```

2. **Arithmetic operations** - As I am not good at math, I find difficult to implement or use arithmetic logic in my program. I really struggled in the Fibonacci practical exam, but I am willing to learn more about this in the coming topics.
3. **Using switch case** - I am not used to using switch case because I rarely do. I usually choose if-else or ternary operators in lieu of this. I find the syntax difficult and kind of confusing.
4. **Loops** - The loops are a new thing introduced to me, and I need to catch up with the lessons. I am ready to put in extra work in the coming lessons to work on this.
5. **Advanced statements** - I find Javascript statements confusing at first, because as I have said before, computer science is something new to me. I find this aspect to be easy, it just requires reading comprehension, but instead of words, formulas for programming.

### _Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items_
1. **Function Declaration** - I will find ways to implement functions in future web development lessons. I will also watch YouTube videos regarding this.
2. **Arithmetic operations** - Whenever I study Math 3, I will try to also find ways to relate it to Computer Science topics.
3. **Using switch case** - I will find time to study the syntax of switch-case operators and prioritize using these whenever applicable on future exercises.
4. **Loops** - I will read tech articles and watch YouTube tutorials, because this is the topic I find most difficult.
5. **Advanced statements** - I will search for Javascript programs in the web and try to decipher what the program will output.

### _In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?_
1. **Effective**
    1. *Speed Tests* - I find speed tests to be adrenaline-inducing, and it provides a way to wake me up, especially when Computer Science is the subject before lunch (hehe). It encourages me to practice and implement programming.
    2. *Demonstration* - Listening to my fellow classmates explain their procedure helps the topics make sense to me especially when I find them complicated in the first place.
2. **Not Effective**
    1. *Lack of take-home activities* - I think I need help searching for advanced practice exercises so that I am more prepared in the long tests.
    2. *Cramming of lessons due to suspensions* - Although this is not something controllable, I hope the next quarters do not face the same number of suspensions because these cause lessons to be crammed, especially when near the periodical exams.
